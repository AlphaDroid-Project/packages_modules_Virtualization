# Android Virtualization Framework (AVF)

Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) provides secure and private execution environments for
executing code. AVF is ideal for security-oriented use cases that require stronger isolation
assurances over those offered by Androidâ€™s app sandbox.

Visit [our public doc site](https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization) to learn more about
what AVF is, what it is for, and how it is structured. This repository contains source code for
userspace components of AVF.

If you want a quick start, see the [getting started guideline](docs/getting_started.md)
and follow the steps there.
